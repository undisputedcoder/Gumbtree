# Gumbtree
A basic REST API for posting ads, similar to Gumtree. The API was created with [FastApi](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi) and utilised Postgres in the backend. 

## Notes
Install the required packages in requirements.txt and run with uvicorn.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd app/
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
*The project was developed with Python 3.8*

**The project was developed as practice and remains incomplete. However, a more fully functional API will be developed**.

The documentation for the API can be found by adding `/doc` to the URL.
